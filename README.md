# SUD-Single-User-Dungeon-

A text-adventure game that allows player to move and fight monsters in a 5*5 dungeon.

Rules:
1. Each time the player move, there is a 25 percent chance that I will encounter a random monster
2. When player encounters a monster, he/she would be able to run away or fight it. If player chooses to fight it, 
it must be combat to the death. If player chooses to run away, there is a 10 percent chance the monster will stab me in
the back and do a random damage from 1 to 4 inclusive as I flee.
3. Every new character has 10 health. A monster has 5 health. When a character strikes a monster, 
it should inflict a random damage from 1 to 6 inclusive. When a monster strikes a character, it should also inflict 
a random damage from 1 to 6 inclusive.
4. A character’s health should increase two points each time the character
moves and does not encounter a monster. A character’s health should never exceed 10.
5. The game ends when the character is dead(health becomes 0).
